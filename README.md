# OpenHouse
OpenHouse is a platform for freelancers to connect and share workspaces. Users of the app can rent out their houses by the hour to other users who want places to work and connect with others in the OpenHouse community.

Some of the features the app supports include:
* Users can create and delete accounts and use them to log in and out.
* Users can search for nearby available rentals by typing in an address.
* Users can customize their public-facing profile pages and post information about their rentals.
* Users can send messages to each other through the app.
* Users can reserve an open house for a specific day and time range.

## Screenshots

This is what a host's public-facing profile page looks like. They have a name and picture for their house, a name and picture for themselves, and some information about their house. They also have a list of amenities that their house has to offer.

This is what the app looks like when you press "Search." The results are shown on the left and their corresponding price tags are displayed on the right-side map.

Abstractly speaking, the clients want to dynamically match any available space with local demand for activities. 
The overall aim is to reduce rent and revolutionize housing affordability.

To do this, we try to create an app that allows rental advertisement of available space ("OpenHouse") to be matched with demands to use those spaces. <br>
The app should support: <br>
&nbsp;    Account creation <br>
&nbsp;    Messaging app, to help support communication between rentor and renter <br>
&nbsp;    Database for numerous and various rentals <br>
&nbsp;    Online payment system <br>

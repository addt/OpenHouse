The house is equipped with a small kitchen and three bathrooms, it also has a cozy living room, four bedrooms, a spacious dining room and a roomy garage.

The building is square shaped. The house is fully surrounded by a garden path.
The second floor is bigger than the first, which creates a stylish overhang on two sides of the house. This floor has a different style than the floor below.

The roof is high and pyramid shaped and is covered with black roof tiles. Two small chimneys sit at either side of the house. Many smaller windows let in plenty of light to the rooms below the roof.
The house itself is surrounded by a modest garden, with mostly grass and a few small trees.",

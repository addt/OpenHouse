Feature: Guest wants to see calendar

    As a guest,
    So that I can make a reservation,
    I want to see a list of the post's available times for the next (roughly) two weeks.
    
Scenario: I want to see when a space is available
  Given I am a Guest
  When I click on "Post"
  Then I should go to the "Post Details" page
  And I should see the "Availability Calendar"
